# Book-Recommender-System
mceval.py restructres the data into a sparse matrix, runs a matrix completion algorithm to fill the matrix, and evaluates the performance of the algorithm using mean squared error.

# Version Issues
If the .py file returns an error, please run the .ipynb file on Google Colab! Sorry, I've been running into library version problems :(

# Installing the fancyimpute library
